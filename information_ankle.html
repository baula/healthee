			<h2> Ankle Sprain Overview </h2>
			<h3> Sprained ankles are the most frequent type of musculoskeletal injury seen by primary-care providers. </h3>
			<h3> Ankle sprains are common sports injuries but also happen during everyday activities. An unnatural twisting motion of the ankle joint can happen when the foot is planted awkwardly, when the ground is uneven, or when an unusual amount of force is applied to the joint. </h3>

			<ul class="info">
				<h3> The ankle joint is made up of three bones: </h3>
				<li>The tibia: the major bone of the lower leg. It bears most of the body's weight. Its bottom portion forms the medial malleolus, the inside bump of the ankle.</li>
				<li>The fibula: the smaller of the two bones in the lower leg. Its lower end forms the lateral malleolus, the outer bump of the ankle.</li>
				<li>The talus: the top bone of the foot.</li>
				<br>
				<h3>Tendons connect muscles to bones: </h3>
				<li> Several muscles control motion at the ankle. Each has a tendon connecting it to one or more of the bones of the foot.Tendons can be stretched or torn when the joint is subjected to greater than normal stress. Chronic inflammation of a stretched or torn tendon is called tendinitis. </li>
				<li> Tendons also can be pulled off the bone, called an avulsion injury. </li>
				<br>
				<h3> Ligaments provide connection between bones. Sprains are injuries to the ligaments. </h3>
				<li> The ankle has many bones that come together to form the joint, so it has many ligaments holding it together. Stress on these ligaments can cause them to stretch or tear. </li>
				<li> The most commonly injured ligament is the anterior talofibular ligament that connects the front part of the fibula to the talus bone on the front-outer part of the ankle joint. </li>

			<h2> What Causes a Knee Dislocation? </h2>
			<ul class="info">
				<li>Knee dislocations are rare. They usually happen only after major trauma, including falls, car crashes, and other high-speed injuries.</li>
				<li>If the knee is dislocated, it will look deformed. The usual straight line of the leg will be crooked or angulated.</li>
				<li>Sometimes, knee dislocations relocate (go back into place) on their own. In this case, the knee will be very swollen and painful. Even if the knee relocates, usually significant damage (tearing) of ligaments has occurred.</li>

			<h2> What Are Symptoms and Signs of a Knee Dislocation? </h2>
			<ul class="info">
				<li>Knee dislocation will always cause severe pain in the knee. Sometimes, there will be no feeling below the knee. </li>
				<li> If the knee relocates, it will become swollen from fluid in the knee and be painful with any movement. Very serious symptoms include loss of a pulse below the knee or loss of feeling or movement below the knee. </li>

			<h2> When Should Someone Seek Medical Care for a Suspected Knee Dislocation? </h2>
			<h3> If a dislocated knee injury is suspected, there is likely severe ligament injury. Go to the nearest hospital's emergency department. Seek care for these reasons: </h3>
			<ul class="info">
				<li> Extreme pain or swelling after a serious injury (such as a car crash) </li>
				<li> An obvious deformity of the knee </li>
				<li> Numbness in the foot </li>
				<li> No pulses in the foot </li>
			</ul>

			<h2> What Exams and Tests Diagnose a Knee Dislocation? </h2>
			<h3> Depending on how the knee looks, the doctor will check the injury for proper diagnosis in the following ways: </h3>
			<ul class="info">
				<li> X-rays: X-rays will be taken to make sure there are no breaks in the bone. </li>
				<li> Examination of pulses: Injury to the arteries in the knee is common with this injury. The doctor will make sure there are pulses in the foot. </li>
				<li> An arteriogram (X-ray of the artery): This X-ray may need to be done to detect injuries to the artery. Some medical centers may also use special ultrasound or Doppler (sound wave) machines to assess the blood flow in the arteries. </li>
				<li> Examination of nerves: Nerves also run through the knee, so it is possible that they may have been damaged. The ability to feel touch and to move certain muscle groups are the main ways nerves are tested. Specifically, the ability to move the foot up and down and to turn the foot inside (inversion) and outside (eversion) are important muscle movements to examine. Any feeling of numbness is concerning for nerve injury. </li>

			<h2> Are There Home Remedies for a Dislocated Knee? </h2>
			<h3> This injury should not be cared for at home. It is best to get medical care as soon as possible. </h3>
			<h3> Placing ice on the injured area may help for some pain control and to decrease some of the swelling. But the most important treatment is to have a doctor assess the injury and relocate or put the knee back in place. </h3>

		<div class="treatment" id="treatment">
			<h2> What Is the Treatment for a Knee Dislocation? </h2>
			<ul class="info">
				<li> Relocation: The doctor will move your lower leg back into position, a process called reduction. Most doctors will do reduction after a person has been given pain medication or is given "conscious sedation," where the patient is sedated enough to withstand the discomfort of relocation but not completely sedated. Relocation is an important early step in repairing damage to nerves, blood vessels, ligaments, and other tissues of the knee. Relocation is usually done by emergency and orthopedic doctors. </li>
				<li> If an arterial injury is determined to be present, immediate surgery by a trauma or vascular surgeon to repair the injured vessel(s) and maintain blood flow to the leg is necessary. </li>
				<li> Immobilization: To keep further injury from happening and to help with the beginning of healing, the entire knee joint will be kept in a splint or immobilizer. This will keep the knee from bending and help the tissues to start healing. </li>
				<li> Referral: A knee dislocation almost always has severe tears and sprains of the ligaments and sometimes has breaks in the bones of the knee. After swelling has gone down, the knee may need reconstruction surgery to regain function. A bone specialist (orthopedist) will need to see you after this injury. </li>

			<h2> What Is the Prognosis of a Knee Dislocation? </h2>
			<h3> In general, this is a very serious injury. Recover is possible, but often the injured knee does not regain its previous capacity to adsorb stresses. It is not uncommon for doctors to recommend some types of supportive wraps or devices to protect the knee and to reduce stresses on it, especially during activities like skiing or playing football. Some knee dislocations cause so much damage that some doctors will suggest that certain activities are avoided altogether. </h3>

			<ul class="info">
				<li> Almost all knee dislocations require reconstruction surgery because major injury to the artery occurs in many knee dislocations and because of the severe ligament injury. </li>
				<li> After appropriate treatment and surgery, however, results have been good. Knees return close to normal in most cases. Chronic pain is a common problem. The prognosis is best with an optimal rehabilitation exercise program. </li>
